**Insights:**

1.	Warner Bros. Leads in Revenue: The “Total Gross by Studios” bar chart shows that Warner Bros. has the highest worldwide gross among all the studios, followed closely by Disney.
2.	Comedy is the Most Profitable Genre: The pie chart “Profitability by Genre” highlights that comedy films account for the largest share of profitability (45.59%), followed by action (32.46%) and drama (18.18%).
3.	Audience Scores vs. Critics’ Scores: The “Total Audience Score % vs Total Critics Score %” chart shows that comedy films have the highest audience score, but there’s a noticeable gap between audience and critic ratings across most genres.
4.	High Total Worldwide Gross: The dashboard displays a total gross of $10,089M from 74 films, reflecting strong performance in terms of box office revenue, with an average audience rating of 64.14%.

Areas of improvement for studios to increase profitability:

1.	Diversify Genre Focus: Comedy is currently the most profitable genre, but studios could benefit from investing more in underperforming but potentially lucrative genres like animation and fantasy. Expanding into genres with growing audiences can lead to higher profitability.
2.	Enhance Audience-Critic Alignment: Bridging the gap between audience scores and critic reviews by producing films that appeal to both groups could improve reputation and word-of-mouth marketing, driving higher box office returns.
3.	Leverage Smaller Independent Films: Studios should explore more collaboration with independent filmmakers or smaller studios to diversify their portfolio with lower-budget, high-reward films. This could lead to higher margins and a broader audience reach.
